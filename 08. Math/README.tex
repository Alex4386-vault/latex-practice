\maketitle

According to my research, The Ya-hoo man: Speedrunner Mario can not achieve \textbf{hyperspeed}.

But in order to achieve that, mario should achieve speed at least of $0.9997c$ which is a lot for little mario.

And due to following equation:

\[ E = mc^2 \]

you might get seizures when you reach that speed.

\begin{math}
StarFox = HI-YA
\end{math}

\begin{equation}
    StarFox = HI-YA = EKU-YAH-DAY-COMMON
\end{equation}

So what i want to say is \emph{OPEN THE DOOR NOW}
